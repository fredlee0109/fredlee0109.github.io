                                    As I am a huge gamer, I have been in UC Berkeley's StarCraft team ever since I was a freshman, playing in collegiate starleague, which is a tournament for college students fighting for a big prize and glory. This season, UC Berkeley's StarCraft team advanced to the Grand Finals, which took place in DreamHack Austin for an offline final, meaning that we would all fly over to Austin, Texas, stay in hotel for 3 nights, and play at a grand stage in one of the biggest eSports event. UC Berkeley has a history of 3 Championship titles and 1 Finalist title, and as we were going against Temple University, that has no history in collegiate StarCraft...

                                    There are probably a lot more resources out there in making websites, but here is how I did it: I just coded everything from scratch. Why? One obvious option I could've rather taken was to just use <a href="https://wordpress.com" style="color:#473B41">WordPress</a> or <a href="https://vix.com" style="color:#473B41">Vix.com</a>, but I wouldn't have FULL control over my website. Plus, I will probably be paying some extra service fees. Another option was to use already existing HTML templates. In fact, I have already researched and tried multiple templates, and they turned out to be extremely sleek and easy. But the problem came when I wanted to change something in my website...

                                    Everyone has characters within themselves. Some are shown, and some are only known to the person themself. I too have many personalities, and I hope through blogging, I can show what kind of a person I truly am behind the layers. But most of the time, I won't know what I'm even talking about, so don't take it too seriously. Some professional and 'serious' writings will also be posted on my <a href="https://medium.com/@freshy_freddy" style="color:#473B41">Medium</a> page. This page is just ultimately for my food for thoughts. Ok, bye.
