                                    There are probably a lot more resources out there in making websites, but here is how I did it: I just coded everything from scratch. Why? One obvious option I could've rather taken was to just use <a href="https://wordpress.com" style="color:#473B41">WordPress</a> or <a href="https://vix.com" style="color:#473B41">Vix.com</a>, but I wouldn't have FULL control over my website. Plus, I will probably be paying some extra service fees. Another option was to use already existing HTML templates. In fact, I have already researched and tried multiple templates, and they turned out to be extremely sleek and easy. But the problem came when I wanted to change something in my website. I couldn't just add extra few lines of HTML/CSS/jQuery, because chances are, already existing code will probably overwrite your shit. To figure this out, I'd had to understand most of the code of the template... And if you ever opened these templates... they literally have tens of files with extremely unorganized piles of shitty codes. I'd rather shoot myself than try to understand all these stuff. Besides, creating a simple blog wouldn't require that many lines of code...

                                    So just fuck it all. I'll just learn everything and code it myself. So I tried watching HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery tutorial videos online, but I couldn't pull myself to watch more than 4 hours LOL and I just gave up. It was too boring, no longer had the same motivation, and much would rather play League of Legends. That was 1 year ago, and you can probably track my github activity 1 year ago and see some random commits to fredlee0109.github.io repository.

                                    So last semester, I enrolled in Web Design Decal, which is a 2-unit p/np decal class taught by some random smart UC Berkeley kids. But I had schedule conflicts so I just yolo'd out.

                                <p>
                                    This semester, however, my schedule worked out perfectly, and I took the class. For the first few months, I was so motivated to build some of the prettiest websites in the world - motivated because I've been procrastinating this for literally a year LOL. Then the slump happened, of course, just like everything in my life. I started to not go to class, in fact, I didn't even go to any of my classes.. But I managed to do all the homework because I'm a CS major and I know how to code some jQuery functions. And the final project was coming up. 'THIS IS IT!' my brain randomly shouts out the other parts of my body. I finally created this blog from scratch, with the motivated by the fact that I would probably not-pass this class if I choose to yolo it. Hosting my website on a server was hella easy. I just googled soem key words, and I was able to set it up within like 5 minutes. Now I can show off to my recruiters that I coded my blog which took me a whole year. What an accomplishment.
