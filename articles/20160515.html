                                    My Plans for the week before Amazon

                                <p>
                                    My internship at Amazon in Seattle starts on May 24th, and my flight to Seattle from San Francisco is on May 21st, so from today, I have exactly 1 week before going to Seattle. With very few friends left in Berkeley to hang, and limited number of games I can actually play on my GTX 650 MacBook Pro, here are the things I plan to do to make my week as efficient as possible. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    1) Learn more about Unix and have writing articles on my blog more streamlined using Unix. My initial thought is to alias "newblog" that goes to my blog directory, and open up text editor. This is the important part: my articles are organized as 1.html, 2.html, etc, number indicating the number of the article. *I also should change the format to be more easily identifiable, such as 20160515.html or something...* So when I open up my text editor, it should also create the next #.html with all contents already formatted for that #, that includes changing up a little bit in my disqus iframe and some a href's. I think that is possible with "rename" Unix command, but I have to research a little bit into it. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    2) Create a filter on my blog (ie. "Filter by Date", "Filter by Category", etc options). I found out that this is possible with some jQuery integration with CSS, but again, I'd have to research more into it, and change my code. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    3) Create a Project page on my website. There are so many projects that I was not able to list on my resume due to space, and I wanted a page that showcases all of them with sufficient detail. Luckly, my LinkedIn has the entire list (yea... I didn't delete any of them on there)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    4) Research some Sublime packages, and install ones that I really need. If you've been following my blog for some time, you'll notice that there are a number of spelling and grammar errors. That is because I'm using Sublime text to write my blog, and it doesn't (and it shouldn't because Sublime is usually used for writing code, and most coding words aren't neccessarily correct English words..) support spell check. Googling for the Sublime spell check functionality shows that it is indeed possible to add spell check functionality, so I'd have to research into that as well.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    5) Review Java and OOP. Amazon is very known for using Java as its main programming language, and I'm sure my team (Amazon Fulfillment Technologies) will be using Java at least little bit. I've been using mostly Python these days because all of my CS classes wewre using Python as the main language this semester, and it's been almost a half a year since I've ever used Java (last one was during my coding interview with various companies, including Amazon). I also need to refresh on data structures (I've only been using array and hash map this semester LOL) and some space and time complexity analysis. Luckily, I'm pretty solid in scalability right now because CS 188 mostly dealt with dealing with huge database, where I used out-of-core algorithms and PySpark to do big computations.
                                </p>
